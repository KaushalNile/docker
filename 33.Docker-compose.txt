Docker Compose
To manage multi-container applications (can work with 1 container also).
Its cumbersome to manually enter build and run and remove commands everytime we code.
Docker Compose compresses all the commands needed in 1 file. And replaces all the commands required by just 1 command.
-- docker-compose up        
    by default runs with --rm flag and in attached mode
   docker-compose up -d
    detached mode
